With existing education materials collected, curated, and gap-analyzed in [Section 1](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Collect%20and%20Curate%20Content.md), the next steps are to begin augmenting existing resources and create new training materials using a "Three Legged Stool" approach.  The three legs of the education stool represent different styles of material delivery to learners.  The first type are traditional instructor-led or Comptuer Based Training (CBT) style classes/courses.  The second learning strategy is hands-on labs and hackathon-style events, where we will use is tactile, and appeals to learners that need to actually performa activities to reeinforce learning.  The Last leg of our education stool is what we've termed "Supplemental" or "real-time" learning activities such as documentation, blogs, podcasts, and the like.  These allow maximim flexibility for the learner to ingest and make connectsion with at their own pace.
