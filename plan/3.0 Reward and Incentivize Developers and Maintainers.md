Developers are tasked with multiple, oftentimes conflicting, priorities.  Simply [collecting](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Collect%20and%20Curate%20Content.md) the best existing materials and then [creating](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Expand%20Training.md) new content is not sufficient for many to take on additional work or to change existing processes.  Learners of all types must be provided additional encouragement and awards to make adopting these tools and techniques worth their time and efforts.


## 3.1 Goal: Major hubs reflect training and certifications

### Explanation: Work with the major “hubs” for OSS development (e.g., GitHub and GitLab) and major foundations (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, etc) to reflect the certifications and accomplishments of contributors and maintainers to the open source projects they house, and in doing so encourage major OSS projects to have their maintainers complete these courses

### Key Steps/Milestones

Y1:

- **M1**: List currently available individual contributor badges and recognition from noted sources that include cybersecurity training as a focus.
  - [ ] Develop a curated list of open certifications beyond the training/education resources established in Section 1, and make available for easy search by professional and student training profile. 
- **M2**: Work with the Curation Team to identify training pathways that align.
  - [ ] Tie contributor badging/training pathways to allow for an extended learning path beyond the scope of the learning platform delivered in Section 2: our aim is to provide security training to cover gaps in the current trianing landscape, and this pathway alignment will allow learners to know which additional training resources within Linux Foundation and related training platforms they can pursue for further specialization.
- **M3**: Contact GitHub and GitLab to establish which certifications are already available for this goal(bug bounties that coordinate with OSSF, etc) (David, Xavier, Sal, CROB)
  - [ ] Initial contact with Github has been established (David W., Sal K.) to understand scope of integration
  - [ ] Contact with Gitlab and other major developer platforms to be engaged in Y1
  - [ ] Identify any other development platforms to be engaged in Y2

## 3.6 Goal: Incentivize maintainers/contributors to take courses

### Explanation: Open Source cybersecurity enablement must be rapidly accelerated by ensuring maintainers of critical open source projects are sufficiently trained to understand both preventative best practices and supply chain security awareness. To close the gap between qualified maintainers and qualified security contributors, we will incentivize two developer types: Maintainers of critical projects, and cybersecurity focused contributors (as defined by the badging processes developed in 3.2)

### Key Steps/Milestones

Maintainers:

- **M1**: Encourage devs to identify successors and provide a contribution ladder with education/certifications as part of successor growth
  - [ ] To ensure that open source projects can maintian security readiness, we are supporting a contribution ladder, as outlined in 3.2: all maintainers who recieve security training will also nominate another maintainer or contributor to co-train and operate as with two security contacts for every critical project. 
  
- **M2**: Scholarships/grants/grants for developers: “Connect the dots” for projects from developers to sos.dev to reward developers, ensure there is a clear and guaranteed compensation model
  - [ ] Reward projects that participate in the best practices as outlined by OSSF Scorecard, as well as supplimental best practices like timely patches as outined in  SOS.dev. In this goal we will standardize the pathways of reward from maitainer education to SOS.dev rewards. 

- **M3**: Identify selected maintainers of top OSS projects, pay them to take courses/have certifications! (upskilling)
  - [ ] Maintainers will be selected by the criticality of their project to their respective ecosystems, as well as he demonstrated security need. These will be done by an applicaton basis, where they will need to provide the status of their current security practices and a commitment to completing both education and mentorship to ensure the security of their projects.  

- **M4**: Add requirement for some OSS projects/employers/proprietary projects: “all maintainers must take a course in developing secure software, here are some examples”
  - [ ] After the analysis of impact from the educational, scholarship and supplimentary resources distributed in Y1, we will be able to recommend clusters of education that best fist existing and emerging security profiles that developers should pursue for open source contributon, secure open source developer employement, and secure propriety development. 

- **M5** Award/Highlight “Most secure oss project” award;
  - [ ] Recognize projects that implement best known security practices and timely patches, as well as heathly community practices such as intentional training of new maintianers with security skillsets. Security practices are continously evolving, and highlighting projects that demonstrate excellence will create a positive incentive model for maintainers across ecosystems. 

- **M6**: Contributors:
  - [ ] Contributor Rewards for those pursuing the "Open Source Security Contributor" badge will recieve rewards for both best practice implementations, recommendations, and patches: both code and non-code contributions can be rewarded if they demonstrate positive security posture for open source projects, and will be recognized by nomination from open souce maintainers at the end of Y1 and Y2, and rewarded with incentives in M7 below. 

- **M7**: Community:
  - [ ] Support/mentor devs as they take training/certifications (AMA webinar, office hours, full-on mentoring, etc) - mentoring/networking mentor badge
  - [ ] Tickets to conferences/training in a centralized information radiator (in coordination with the curated content)
  - [ ] Security Swag - $80,000

## 3.7 Goal: All programs, outreach, and engagement efforts will include success criteria that show the effectiveness of the program beyond completion rates prior to their implementation

### Explanation
The aim of this section is to ensure that all strategic implementations of section 3 are measurable: we will use the baseline employment statistics presented in the 2022 Linux Foundating Open Source Hiring Report to understand which badges provide verifiable increase in employment, trainee and employer satistfaction as well as global correlations between hiring and security readiness. We will follow this baseline within an annual subreport on cybersecurity education, employment and supply chain readiness indicators. 

### Key Steps/Milestones

- **M1**: Number of people taking courses/completions (certifications)
  - [ ] Identify known completion rates of current openly available courseware and any known statistics around employment for our initial baseline indicator. 

- **M2**: Maintainer-related - Scorecard (80%+)
  - [ ] Quantify number of Open Source Maintainers upskilled with cybersecurity training, and any direct correlations this has to metrics of security readiness: OSSF Scorecard, improved mean time to patch and incident response for critical projects.  

- **M3**: Criteria related to all areas (university, trade school, pre-university, etc.) focused on the first 1-2 year plans
  - [ ] Quantify which proposed Y1 learner personas and professional personas have the most common, distributable usage as well as any direct indicators of employment or retention from training, badging, and verified contributions. 

- **M4**: Track the success rate of rendering security skillsets to hiring engagement - post-completion hiring assessment
  - [ ] We will follow this baseline within an annual subreport on cybersecurity education to see if there are any global trends and indicators in employment metrics both within cybersecurity and employment trends in DevOps, SecDevOps, and related domains.
