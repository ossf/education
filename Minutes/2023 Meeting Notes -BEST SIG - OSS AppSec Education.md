    * Voting starts 16Dec for all registered voters
* VulnCon CFP - [https://www.first.org/conference/vulncon2024/](https://www.first.org/conference/vulncon2024/) 
    * VulnCon Mar25-27 RDU, NC USA
    * Deadline 31Jan2024
* OSS-NA CFP - [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/) 
    * OSS-NA April 16-18 Seattle, WA USA 
    * Deadline 14Jan2024
* Discussion: David A. Wheeler to talk with GB about current fundamentals course
    * Fundamentals course gets 4.5/5.0 reviews on average (great!) and we have 22K registrants. BUT, ‚Äúevery developer‚Äù should learn this, if they don‚Äôt already know it then please take our course!. Let‚Äôs talk to GB.
    * Action Item: David A. Wheeler will talk with the following audiences in Q1: General Board - What are the blockers to requiring this in your org/adopting the course?
    * GB: Premier members about how they use the training content (and if not, ask what‚Äôs holding them back). ‚ÄúWhat could we do to make your members enthusiastically take these courses?
    * General OpenSSF members at Q1 event, ‚ÄúWhat would it take to get your organization to adopt this course for developers?‚Äù maybe try to get OpenSSF members (& maybe others) to mandate the fundamentals course
    * Maybe David could propose a talk - (Jan 14 - CFP deadline - maybe talk about class and/or GB feedback) - OSS-NA CFP - CRob is glad to assist as needed
    * Dave Russo: Awareness is a major problem, many developers aren‚Äôt aware of it. Adding it to an LMS will help. Caution against ‚Äúmandate‚Äù, there‚Äôs a time commitment. Use ‚Äúencourage‚Äù instead, then think about requirement later.
    * Eddie: Do we have a convincing argument on why every minute in 16 hours is valuable?
        * ROI.
        * Foundation will work with LF Research & application security training. Maybe done by Fall 2023.
        * ISC2 is also a member, they might have data
        * Training is good, not training is bad.
        * The more we can get _trusted_ people to say ‚ÄúI took this course, it had valuable‚Äù
            * Maybe ask CNCF ambassadors? Maybe getting OpenSSF to pay for their tiem & honest feedback
            * Ask who‚Äôs already taken the course & would be willing to talk about it.
            * Search for those who‚Äôve publicly acknowledged getting the cert & ask some.
            * DevRel podcast - could talk about the class, interview people who took the class
            * Could write blog, talking about classes. Maybe EvilTux.
        * Elevator pitch & testimonials - out to those who haven‚Äôt heard about it.
* Alternative: Google AdWords, etc. - market fundamentals
* Discussion: Proposal: Fundamental exercises (labs) - implement with Client-side JavaScript
    * The main thing we‚Äôve heard missing so far is ‚Äúwould like labs‚Äù
    * Containers - optional? Required?
    * Download all labs with ‚Äúgit clone‚Äù or download an archive
    * One programming language to start (or we‚Äôll never finish)
    * Client-side - don‚Äôt need server support
    * No installation required - use browser to run code, and it‚Äôs automatically isolated (for environments that don‚Äôt like to install software or worry about running it)
    * JavaScript is widely known & is a simple enough language to ‚Äúlearn the basics‚Äù
    * We can add other languages later. Python & Java especially likely.
    * Memory-safe material is a challenge - but that‚Äôs a small part of the course
    * David to create 1st lab or 2 as example (‚Äúexemplars‚Äù), get reviews from smaller then larger group (weekly newsletter), then see if we can get other volunteers.
    * Not Babel / TypeScript - want to minimize toolchains
* David A. Wheeler: OpenSSF staff and LF Training & Certification talked yesterday, want to develop roadmap so various courses coordinate better. Fundamentals covers fundamentals, is free. If you want more specifics (e.g., 10 hour course on Threat Modeling instead of 10 min, or 10 hour course on tools instead of 30 min), can take separate course that drills in.
    * David will chat with Tim S.
    * Let‚Äôs get the LF T&C list of planned courses to make sure roadmap works out
    * See our notes from earlier this year
    * Issue: Course maintenance. There‚Äôs overhead to it. Include maintenance as part of plan.
* Can we create a centralized home for ‚Äúwhen things need to change?‚Äù 
    * For WG, have a source of truth of ‚Äúcourses we‚Äôve done & how to maintain it‚Äù
* Sign up to get OpenSSF newsletter: [https://openssf.org/sign-up/](https://openssf.org/sign-up/)

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
* Welcome new friends
* Collect Opens
* David: Working on a less-ambitious education strategy that can be executed [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SrFkV4JRpqTSonp7VTKhyLYVpzOzSzgW4eOKlfCYwO8/edit#heading=h.qzrjscev9ut3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SrFkV4JRpqTSonp7VTKhyLYVpzOzSzgW4eOKlfCYwO8/edit#heading=h.qzrjscev9ut3)
    * Priorities in order:
        * Expand fundamentals with labs
        * Something for managers
        * Drill down into specific topics (as time available)
    * Trimmed-down focus is better, priorities make sense, we can make adjustments if we get new donations.
* CRob has started weekly with GB chair.
    * Miraculously, Intel work to release management material is moving again, though the lead is in Israel which obviously has real-world challenges.
    * If necessary, can strip out images
    * Don‚Äôt know what the content is, it‚Äôs ¬Ω-full day
    * Several organizations expressed interest in
        * Abishay (Microsoft) was looking into things for possible donation
        * IBM also looking into things for donation
* Funding request re: documentation on processes
    * ‚ÄúGives and gets‚Äù - what does a WG, SIG, project get & what do they need to deliver?
    * That may unlock a fund to seed initiatives: grants, hiring developers, etc.
    * [https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/226](https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/226)
* DEI committee promoted to a full WG!!  (yay!)  They will still collab with us on EDU things, but now have a broadened
* [https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security) Do we want to try and line up our ideas about a secure dev curriculum into something like the roadmap.io ‚Äújourney‚Äù?  Something like below:
*  

![image](https://github.com/ossf/education/assets/128058721/86ebf03a-93c3-46fb-a2b7-8dd0ccf35c1f)

    * Defining these skills also helps us with secure dev skills list: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/257](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/257) 
    * And could feed into secure developer job description [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/256](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/256) 
* What is our coverage in the security domains: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=1542461259](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=1542461259)   Does this help ID where we may want to develop/find/petition for content?
* It‚Äôd be nice to auto-check education
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/255](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/255)
    * [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534)
* Question (if we have time): If a key thing to do is ‚Äúadd labs‚Äù for fundamentals, are there specific recommendations on doing so?
    * LIkely prefer a lot of JavaScript examples (instead of ‚Äúany‚Äù language). Maybe some Python. C ones might be C-specific. Seth Michael Larsen might be willing to create some Python labs. Cheuk has a dev background. Create 1-2 labs as templates/examples. 
    * LIkely focus on client-side labs (don‚Äôt need massive server resources) - maybe release as sets of files? Containers?
    * We could do a ‚Äúcall to action‚Äù to ask for help, with contributing guide.

        * We should provide a reasoned response to the opposition
        * CRob will talk directly with Scorecard
        * Avishay: I do favor this proposal. Measuring education is important
    * [Issue 256](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/256) - trained security dev job description (share with CISA)
    * [Issue 257](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/257) - secure dev skills list
    * [Issue 258 ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/258)- OSSF Technical Initiative trainings (task force adjacent)
*  David‚Äôs requests
    * Trying to collect a list of courses on developing secure software (to compare with our own). I already know about CSSLP exam, SafeCode. More info welcome!
        * SANS has ‚Äúdefensive coding‚Äù class
        * CRob - AppSec panel. I‚Äôll reach out to them.
        * Spreadsheet about free ones from last year‚Äôs exercise: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=0) - focusing on free ones
        * developing Visual diagrams similar to this about OpenSSF security skills may be helpful for developer to decide what to learn. //[www.sans.org/blog/a-visual-summary-of-sans-cloudsecnext-summit-2023/](www.sans.org/blog/a-visual-summary-of-sans-cloudsecnext-summit-2023/)

        * CMU.
        * [https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security) 
    * Intend to create a list of ‚Äúthings we could do for education without lots of $$‚Äù. If you have ideas/suggestions, please add! (Thanks to Tim S. for conversation last week)
        * Tim: One idea: Adding specific exercises on the existing course for developing secure software. E.g., as containers.
            * David: Happy to do it!
            * Tim: There‚Äôs a pyramid of value. Passive video is least helpful. Multi-mode is more helpful. Practical exercises that solidify what‚Äôs learned is the most valuable. The most important is synthesis.
        * EvilTux for technical blogs, demos, etc.
        * Podcast (yay) - expert interviews with tech influencers & devs on topics of interest for appsec/supply chain sec
        * SKF exercises

* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
* Welcome new friends
* Collect Opens
* [SOSS Summit](https://openssf.org/soss-vision-brief/) Task Force:
    * BEST[ Issue 258](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/258) - creation of foundation project training materials - Randall will assist
    * BEST [Issue 255](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/255) - Trained developer scorecard entry - Scorecard issue[ #3534](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534)
    * BEST[ Issue 256](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/256) - Secure Dev Job Description 
    * BEST[ Issue 257](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/257) - Security skills for devs list
* Are there any other projects or materials this group wants to collaborate on?
* Randall - skill foundry + evil tux are ways to help educational efforts
    * Evil Tux - new ‚Äúhip‚Äù effort to generate deeper technical content for ‚Äùhands on keyboard‚Äù folks. Blog. Legal did ask us to say ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not inherently evil, he just questions everything‚Äù. Going live in 2-3 weeks (by kubecon) [https://eviltux.com/](https://eviltux.com/)
* Do we need to change our meeting cadence?
* OpenSSF: We‚Äôre working on how funds could be distributed, keeps getting kicked down the road
* Propose: New scope, create material, go to conferences, educational materials.
    * Randall: We want to let projects create content & not worry about distributing the content. ‚ÄúSkill Foundry‚Äù is one of those platforms.
* David: I created: ‚ÄúA Brief Introduction to Developing Secure Software‚Äù - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GzLX4CYr4HtXrNF6wyO11hzz9EgwriKhnbvVZ9-LG2E/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GzLX4CYr4HtXrNF6wyO11hzz9EgwriKhnbvVZ9-LG2E/edit) - comments?
    * Let‚Äôs create a GitHub issue to get people to comment
    * Best practices WG README
    * Jay: I think this is a fantastic idea!
    * We should steal a conference room & present. We could also walk through a module. Every quarter, pick a set of module. Could be a speaker at a conference. Documentation is getting created, but need to get out there
* Should we (SIG) exist?
    * We have no funding, none is coming, need to change or disappear
    * Jay: We should exist, with a new scope
    * Maybe focus on getting this information out there in person, ‚Äúpriming the pump‚Äù. In-person provides more.
    * Maybe create the mini-classes.
    * Conferences aren‚Äôt free, have to pay to go to
* SKF has a bunch of labs. There is ‚ÄúSKF-lite‚Äù for coursework. However, the plan is for labs to be attached to courses instead of being independent.
* Skill Foundry courses will probably not be part of main LF catalog, they‚Äôll be separate.
    * It‚Äôs a promotional issue. Skill Foundry - 1 platform to share across LF projects. Each LF project will have an ‚Äúinstance‚Äù to put its own courses in.
    * Instructional Design (ID)
* Tim S: We do have various products. We very much want to help projects create professional training. Skill Foundry is aimed at others.
    * OpenSSF - want a course? Contact Tim, will upload that to an LMS
    * Skill Foundry is for cases where the LF Training‚Äôs resources are mostly not being used, not going to our LMS. It‚Äôs for cases where you want to put up a course without using LF Training‚Äôs resources. That way people can point information that‚Äôs really different, more of a self-service opportunity. It‚Äôs basically an LMS. We‚Äôre building it.
* David: I propose make a new education plan, limit it to a page, on what we / education will do, given limited funding (mostly time) - include commitments
    * Create brief presentations, go out & present it (e.g., as tutorials)
    * (SOSS summit points)
    * David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôll commit to start drafting a new (short) plan. Short so we can focus on execution.
        * Jay: I‚Äôll help!
    * Keep updating fundamentals course

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
* Welcome new friends
* Collect Opens
* Follow-up from WDC SOSS meeting
    * Create a ‚Äúsecure developer training‚Äù check for the Scorecard.  If a credential or certification can be found, present that alongside the standard scorecard checks to highlight projects that have trained developers/maintainers. This was enthusiastically discussed.
        * We would need to define what it is, then work with the scorecard team to implement it on their side
        * David: I suggest starting with the certificate of completion for the secure software development fundamentals course. LF uses Credly. We can investigate various APIs, I believe we can match this up. If we can use the LFX database to match up people, it‚Äôd be even better & I think we can do that without GDPR problems. We can then add others, e.g., LinkedIn, ISC2. I‚Äôm very enthusiastic about this.
        * Potentially use Credly and LinkedIn to identify industry badges that would count for this as well (e.g. ISC2)
        * Can this also be extended to contributors?
        * Created [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534) in Scorecard repo request this new feature
    * Create a ‚ÄúSecure Developer‚Äù Job description that lists off key skills that should be sought after by hiring organizations.  Vet this with HR/People team professionals and then attempt to influence US government & member adoption.
        * [Tim] Complexity due to wide differences between what orgs look for - opinions; maybe use smaller group with track record to put a tight definition on this
    * Create a ‚ÄúSecurity Skills for Developers‚Äù document that lists key skills job applicants should have, along with ways to acquire those skills/credentials, and evangelize to academia and to developers.
        * [Tim] Big corps and academia are difficult lifts, perhaps look to newer organizations (e.g. new IPO) to help define this (these are also ‚Äúmore desirable‚Äù positions). Sadly, academia is often not near the cutting edge.
        * [DavidW] A basic list should be easy to come up with - the stuff that has been around is the important stuff, newer things may or may not be critical; use the 80/20 rule to come up with the list and it should get buy-in. If the problem has been a problem for the last 50 years, it‚Äôs probably going to stay a problem. Getting it used in larger orgs will still be a challenge
    * Creation of OSSF Project training videos so that people can become informed about: 
* Sigstore 
* Scorecard 
* S2C2F 
* SLSA 
* Secure software consumption 
* BP Badges 
* And others 
    * Additional training/collateral will be create to explain Scorecard criteria 
        * Help provide clarity of what the different measurements are
* Working on Education section of [CISA RFI](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/we-want-your-input-help-secure-open-source-software) Response 
    * Pitching expanding reach of current classes, development of additional coursework targeting different levels of learners, edu focused on oss consumers
* We created an issue: [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3534) - proposing Scorecard add a check for developer education.

* [TAC Issue 189](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/189) Sarah Evans added follow up questions to continue progress
    *  We spent a lot of time developing a plan that we expected to be funded
        * we‚Äôve had no feedback, no funding
        * All is paused, because we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen with funding
        * The TAC ‚Äúthis is good & should be funded‚Äù. GB has not responded
        * If GB/TAC had said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no funding‚Äù that would be clearer, we have no answer
        * Would it be better to extract out the parts that don‚Äôt require funding?
    * Sarah is an alternate on the GB, is interested in making progress
    * Randall: LF has taken steps within education. SKF, skill foundry, ‚Äúevil tux‚Äù (purple tux) formerly dead drop. We‚Äôd be willing to help this group get education out there
        * David: All true. I think LF education & this group could collaborate more, e.g., review, help develop, etc. By pulling together more, we could do more
        * Randall: I also manage the AI stuff
        * Anyone‚Äôs welcome to contribute
        * Skill foundry is its own part of SKF, now for all projects, each will have its own tenant
        * Working with evil tux?
    * Idea: Have Randall present current LF education‚Äôs plan for Cybersecurity education (with Tim). Then we create a new plan. Also: Find ways to get reviews/interaction of OpenSSF.
* Yesenia - Alpha - DEI
    * Landing page for call to action (add the youtube videos and all in one place)
    *  (feedback welcome)
* 20Sept call? - CRob and others in Spain‚Ä¶.do we want to have the call?  If so, who can lead it
    * Cancel. Too many people will be in Spain
    * Next call Oct 4.
    * Kassidy is the ‚Äúgo to contact‚Äù for education except for OpenSSF (Randall is the OpenSSF POC)

* [TAC Issue 189](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/189) - re: EDU.SIG - Sarah Evans (Dell)
* BEST WG [MVSR ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/214)- contributions from this SIG welcome
* Project ideas - Express Learning classes

<h3>Opens (pending)</h3>




* Using SCORM to share course
    * At the bottom of [https://openssf.org/training/courses/](https://openssf.org/training/courses/) there‚Äôs a link to request SCORM (SCORM-Connect) integration - see that information for how to get started!
* Randall: Currently learning how to use the TI API
    * Sandbox renamed ot ‚ÄúSkillForge‚Äù

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* If new funding doesn‚Äôt come soon, what do we want to do?
    * What can we do to prepare for that eventual funding, since it‚Äôs been delayed?
* What would we like to put into MVSR?
* Education plan (reviewed by TAC, sent to GB a long time ago):
* The Intel material on managing software development & considering security is in progress, once that arrives we can work it
    * David: I‚Äôm imagining we can create instructor-led & computer-based
* Do we want to create a much shorter (1 hour?) course for in-person workshops? ‚ÄúIntroduction to Secure Software Development‚Äù
    * David: I‚Äôve done that before at FOSDEM
    * CRob: Could be a teaser
    * David: It‚Äôs not crazy, we have to control expectations
    * We‚Äôd need to create material for that
    * Then there‚Äôs travel, etc.
    * Randall: +1
    * This might be easier short-term lift
    * David: I could create that as a starting point, something we can do relatively quickly
* Which in-depth areas? Obvious areas (picking some of the largest ecosystems, considering cost/benefit):
    * JavaScript
    * Java
    * Python
    * C
    * See TIOBE list: [https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
    * David: C++ is widely used, but that‚Äôs more challenging instruction-wise, there are really multiple C++s. I‚Äôd do that later. ‚ÄúGet a win" first.
* Randall: We currently can‚Äôt support labs in new system (TI)

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Cybersecurity education partnership opportunity (Avishay Balter and Tom Ritter)
    * Tom Ritter is the driving force.
    * Today: Why & What. Want schools to get funding for cybersecurity education plans
    * Want to reach some of the mobilization objectives
    * Secondary school statistics for SW Florida region of US ‚ÄúDunbar region‚Äù
        * 83%+ of students no cost or low-cost lunch program (means-tested required to receive)
        * Brownfield site
        * Recent disaster area recovery from hurricane (in addition to COVID)
        * Dunbar HS
    * Working with this school would help us meet several mobilization plan goals
    * This is considered ‚Äúsupplemental‚Äù - after school (essentially extracurricular). They‚Äôll refer students to it, e.g., sophomores & additional students.
    * Is there an intent to give them certification/badging? Plan to use LFD121 & existing LF badging.
    * Don‚Äôt plan to do CompTIA, etc., but that could be done in the future.
    * They use Canvas as their LMS
    * Discussion about identifiers for minors & PII
        * Tom will write an email asking questions, send to David A. Wheeler, David will forward. It‚Äôs possible that LF training & certification has already worked this out
    * David: We (LF) do support SCORM-Connect for LFD121
        * You can request it here: [https://training.linuxfoundation.org/developingsecuresoftwarerequest/](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/developingsecuresoftwarerequest/)
        * SCORM is a standard format for exchanging learning materials
        * SCORM-Connect is a SCORM file with no content, just a redirect that says ‚Äúget data here‚Äù. That enables us to update fixes automatically.
    * Our ask is funding for instructor & scholarships
    * Challenge: since the mobilization plan, economics have changed (many companies have had layoffs) & many governments are focused more on Ukraine.
    * Please create a proposal, so it can be sent to GB
    * CRob: I like that this is very specific & actionable

        * Great opportunity to bring together DEI and Best Groups for execution 
* Updates on Intel donated Content
    * Expect to get the contents this quarter, then need to determine what to do about that
    * Intel Development Manager Training 
        * Are reviewing legal issues of images.
        * Hopefully next month we‚Äôll get the content.
    * Proposal: Can intel just send it, & we‚Äôll promise to replace all the images?
        * If not, what are the kinds of images and/or sources?
    * Unfortunately, the Intel contact (David) is retiring, the replacement is getting read in & hopefully this will continue.

<h3>Opens (pending)</h3>




* Next steps on gathering information about BEST Sig and the surrounding working groups, will need interviews from the leads of each group

    * [Randall] There are several LF classes that touch on these topics; there is a learning path connecting them; concern over adding a new course, what is the demand (needs to be over 10k for them to maintain) and how does it differentiate from the existing ones
        * The content is probably already there, but it might be able to be better organized
        * If the course is mostly reading we can add videos and/or make it hands-on; the SIG can also evangelize
        * Because of the platform this will likely need to remain text-based without moving it to another platform (SKF?) - **@Randall**
    * **@Randall & @Yesey ** will see if they can run through the course and review the content
    * Create with videos and as a lab
    * [Christine] Here‚Äôs an example tutorial I used once - [https://github.com/caabernathy/oss-training](https://github.com/caabernathy/oss-training)

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Welcome new friends
    * Michael Cheng, Space Lazors! Welcome
* Collect Opens
* Update on plan approval‚Ä¶.
    * TAC EDU SIG plan passed with enough votes to move forward.
    * No feedback or changes were required so far.
    * Getting help and we are building a small deck, getting help from Sam
* US Cybersecurity Strategy Section 4.6: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf) 
    * Talks about more Education, Yaaay
    * Governboard talk, another indicator we need to forward with our EDU SIG plan
    * It echoes what other entities in the world think and talk about.
    * It‚Äôs inline of what we are doing here in the EDU SIG
    * They also talking about Grants and scholarships
* [Max] - [https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security)  have we considered this?
    * We like it and it‚Äôs really cool
    * The paths for security experts are really interesting setup and how subsets are mapped against the learners and our profiles
    * Can we reach out to the creator? Max will contact them to see how we can share engagement. 
* Where do we want to start moving the plan forward:
    * Learner Personas‚Ä¶what do learners want to learn about?
        * Gather other personas. Write 3-4 sentences about professional personas, perhaps link them to learner personas.
        * Maybe job boards like Indeed have categories of professional personas that we can draw on.
        * Defining the engineer and security engineer
        * Survey to pull out of the community what the new foundation is
            * delfi group approach
        * AppSec? More than AppSec?
            * Primarily appsec, with some satellites e.g., Kubernetes management, etc. But primarily about writing better code.
            * Scope is ‚ÄúSoftware development security‚Äô - includes kernels, libraries, etc that aren‚Äôt apps per se.
    * Organize Content‚Ä¶. What classes live where?
    * Content Gap analysis‚Ä¶. We‚Äôve got stuff, what‚Äôs missing?
* Randall: In the process of organizing SKF funding, plan, etc.
* David A. Wheeler: Small thing - HTML targets & security. If you know more, please comment (this is a repeat request also made to the best practices WG):

    * Layering education for organizations (OPSO, managers, devs, etc.)
    * End User WG is very suitable for FinOs
* Translations of content into Hebrew & Arabic (Secure Development course)
    * Starting to assess work and testing translation via a doc api.  Getting good results, hoping to colab with the api devs to improve them even more!
* SKF updates
    * SKF is trying to get a monthly demo cadence, to get the Education SIG and LF more involved as stakeholders into the ongoing project.
    * SKF hopes to get more feedback into the content itself and how it is organized.
    * The scope of SKF is increased with more features, and some parts of it should be self-sustainable. 
    * There should be a team effort and perhaps a meeting at regular cadence on SKF
    * SKF = Security Knowledge Framework [https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/](https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/) 
    * GitHub is also working on security knowledge labs, we should try to get them collaborating on SKF‚Äôs new version (Johnathan L.)

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Welcome new friends
* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
* Collect Opens
* Plan still under review by the TAC (Issue [134](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/134))
* DEI Subcommittee started regular meetings (every other Tues at 11am est, next call is 31jan2023)
*  Intel possible content donations:
    * **Advanced secure code development**, an instructor-led course delivered by Intel security experts, who explain and demonstrate the importance of secure software development, while providing developers with the tools they need to improve product security and reliability. During the course, trainees get to know common security flaws through the attacker's eye, practice on identifying and fixing vulnerable code and learn practical methods to make security an essential ingredient in the development process.
    * **HW threat modeling workshop**, an instructor-led workshop that explains the importance of threat modeling, reviews security terminology with examples that demonstrate various terms and how we use them, goes through the threat modeling stages and then uses an example of a HW design to show how to go through all the steps with that design
    * **Secure development mindset,** an instructor-led course that seeks to build an enhanced secure development mindset into all those involved in product development. Instructors cover why this is critical for Intel, who are the attackers and these attackers' mindset and capabilities, then do a deep-dive in the technical issues that have impacted Intel in the past and how those involved in product development (architects, designers, implementors and validators) could have thought and acted differently to help prevent or better detect these issues.
    * **Security for managers,** an instructor-led course that covers security from a manager's perspective ‚Äì basic terms you need to be familiar with, security "mines" you should worry about in the process of delivering a product, how to build a security roadmap for your product and processes you can incorporate in your organization to improve security
    * **Threat modeling**: A hands-on workshop, a four-hour instructor-led workshop that covers Software SAFE‚Äôs approach to threat modeling in a step by step process and allows attendees to apply the material on a working example. Topics cover the purpose of threat modeling, methods of system diagramming for threat modeling, identifying assets, attack surfaces and attackers and using this information to develop a list of threats and associated mitigations.
    * **The principle of least privilege**, a web-based training course that helps product contributors to incorporate the principle of least privilege into design by explaining what least privilege is, basic least privilege design pattern and when in the security development lifecycle (SDL) to address least privilege
    * **Defense in depth for non WIN-Linux environments**, a security short talk about security defenses available for embedded systems developers
    * **Security design principles**, a short video on the ten enduring security design principles
* 

<h3>Opens (pending)</h3>




* [Sal] Anything we want to highlight at OpenUK?
    * Look at 2022 report summarizing the OSSF activities as guides
    * **@All** Please send feedback and suggestions to Sal over Slack or e-mail 

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* No update from the TAC for review of the mobilization plan, but should begin to get feedback by end of week
* DEI committee [[notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdQ07veOcJ596Vo3aQZCFy-HHeEO7cHnbE_6u_uq9Fk/edit#)](lead by Jay White and Christine Abernathy)  had it‚Äôs first official kickoff to roadmap 2023, rallying support for diverse educational outreach 
    * Aims: Make educational materials more accessible to underrepresented groups
    * Shortlist key partners to extend educational outreach
    * Want to focus on OSSNA to highlight the good work they‚Äôve been doing 
        * CFP Brainstorming [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dwm3nrNrToDJ-Dfv7qLheOYvzmzsDVSKxM6AyAFJjn8/edit)
* There will be a strong presence of OSSF at State of Open UK, will strategically raise some of the good work completed in 2022 (reports, guides, and mobilization plan)
* Intel is interested in donating several security sources already available, and they will be adding new courses as well (C++) in the next few months
* New [SKF](http://skf-omega.vercel.app) site available 
* **@Randall** to send CRob question(s) for ClearLinux
